# Integration Theme for Jest-HTML-Reporters

Provides a new lightweight theme for [jest-html-reporters][1] to display
integration tests with a breakdown of domains, scenarios, and tests. For
best use, the theme has an understanding of the gherkin terminology,
and can detect JSON as well as request / responses when using [`addMsg`][2].
